      The distinct shapes and colors of the vivid red and gray rocks near my campsite instantly drew my eye, compelling me to capture them through photography. Growing up, I developed an appreciation for photography, inspired by my mom, who was a master of her craft. Her ability to photograph nature, people, and events shaped the way I view the world, teaching me that memories are often best preserved through images. When I arrived at the campsite, I felt an urge to document the scenery, knowing the memories I made there would become intertwined with the landscape.

    My process was simple and intuitive. Alongside my friends, who brought guitars, drums, and sketchbooks to express themselves, I brought my camera to explore and capture what caught my eye. The rugged yet intricate beauty of the environment captivated meâ€”the deep creases in distant rock formations and the speckled textures up close held a timeless quality. I found myself wondering how these natural effects were created, how time and the elements shaped the land into something so enduring.

    One particularly memorable moment came while discussing the abstract and organic forms of the rocks with a friend. She shared how her drawings were influenced by childhood trips to this very type of landscape, grounding the scene in a deeper narrative of personal history. The interplay between memory, connection, and inspiration fueled my exploration, and one of those shared moments lives within this series.

    In editing, my goal was to enhance the vibrance of the colors and adjust the depth to highlight the interplay of light and shadow. This series reflects my realization that photographs not only preserve memories but also allow us to reimagine and connect with the elements that first captured our attention. Each image has its own composition, much like each memory holds a distinct place in our minds. I invite viewers to reflect on their own memories and interpretations of these images, and to seek out and photograph the moments they most want to remember.
