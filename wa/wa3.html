      A houseplant, sometimes known as a pot plant, potted plant, or an indoor
      plant, is an ornamental plant that is grown indoors.As such, they are
      found in places like residences and offices, mainly for decorative
      purposes. Common houseplants are usually tropical or semi-tropical, and
      are often epiphytes, succulents or cacti.

      The history of houseplants is intertwined with the history of container
      gardening in general. Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians grew ornamental and
      fruiting plants in decorative containers.[citation needed] Ancient Greeks
      and the Romans cultivated laurel trees (Laurus nobilis) in earthenware
      vessels. In ancient China, potted plants were shown at garden exhibitions
      over 2,500 years ago.[citation needed] In the medieval era, gillyflowers
      were displayed in containers.[3]

    <h2>Effects</h2>
    <h3><strong>Human well-being</strong></h3>
    <div style="max-width: 700px; word-wrap: break-word">
      People have long ascribed psychological benefits to growing plants; this
      1915 caption states that "all your cares flee. As a nerve-soothing,
      health-giving, enthusing hobby, it has no equal."[46] There are also many
      claimed psychological and physiological benefits to having houseplants. A
      2022 systematic review with some meta-analyses included 42 studies which
      together measured the following human functions to study the benefits of
      indoor plants:

      <li>Salivary amylase activity</li>
      <li>Critical flicker fusion frequency</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Air quality</strong></h3>
    <div style="max-width: 700px; word-wrap: break-word">
      Although houseplants are commonly considered to have an active, positive
      effect on indoor air quality, much of the non-academic reporting on the
      subject is based on experiments involving the removal of volatile organic
      compounds (VOCs) from the air, the evidence for which is unclear.[37] The
      1989 NASA Clean Air Study was set up to research ways to clean the air in
      sealed environments such as space stations.[38] This included an early
      study on the ability of potted plants to remove VOCs, which concluded that
      plants, specifically a combination of their roots and the soil
      microorganisms, were highly effective.[39][37][40] However, this study
      tested plants in ways which are not representative of an indoor
      environment; in sealed chambers and with highly elevated levels of the
      VOCs benzene, trichloroethylene and formaldehyde.[39] Subsequent studies
      have confirmed the combined role of soil and roots[41][42] and showed that
      they were effective at cleaning in higher VOC concentrations, but only at
      lower concentrations after the process had been "kick-started" by a higher
      level of exposure.[40] Others have shown that is possible to artificially
      enrich the soil directly with VOC-degrading bacteria and achieve the same
      result, and posited that exposure to high VOC levels (or low levels but in
      bursts) during experiments and the subsequent increase in such bacteria
      may have been a cause of the large differences seen in the results of
      various studies.[42] A 2019 review paper calculated that it would require
      between 10 and 1000 houseplants per square meter to achieve the same level
      of VOC removal as occurs from passive exchange between indoor and outdoor
      air.[37] Houseplants do have a statistically significant effect on the
      concentrations of both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in normal indoor
      environments, reducing carbon dioxide levels by 10–25% and carbon monoxide
      levels by up to 90%.[43]

    <h2>Care</h2>

    <div style="max-width: 700px; word-wrap: break-word">
      Most houseplants are species that have adapted to survive in a temperature
      range between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F) year-round, as those adapted for
      temperate environments require winter temperatures outside of normal
      indoor conditions.[28] Within that limitation, there are houseplants which
      are native to many different types of habitats, from tropical rainforests
      to succulents and cacti native to deserts. Many houseplants are either
      epiphytes or live in seasonally dry ecosystems that help them adapt to the
      dry indoor air and inconsistent watering many houseplants are subject to.
      Often, houseplants from tropical areas are understory plants, and because
      they grown in shady conditions naturally, they are often able to thrive in
      lower-light conditions.
