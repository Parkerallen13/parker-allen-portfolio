      -Sometimes known as a pot plant, potted plant, or an indoor
      plant, is an ornamental plant that is grown indoors.As such, they are
      found in places like residences and offices, mainly for decorative
      purposes. Common houseplants are usually tropical or semi-tropical, and
      are often epiphytes, succulents or cacti.

      The history of houseplants is intertwined with the history of container
      gardening in general. Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians grew ornamental and
      fruiting plants in decorative containers.[citation needed] Ancient Greeks
      and the Romans cultivated laurel trees (Laurus nobilis) in earthenware
      vessels. In ancient China, potted plants were shown at garden exhibitions
      over 2,500 years ago.[citation needed] In the medieval era, gillyflowers
      were displayed in containers.[3]

      The expansion of European colonialism brought Europeans into contact with a 
      wide variety of new plants, especially tropical plants more suited to growing 
      as houseplants. Explorers and botanists brought over 5,000 species to Europe 
      from South America, Africa, Asia and Australia.[5]

      Forcing plants to bloom out of season, especially bulbs, grew in popularity during 
      the 18th century.[6]: 48  The decorative pot or cachepot specifically for growing 
      houseplants (as opposed to a simple terracotta pot, or a decorative vase) was developed 
      in this era as ceramic manufacturing took off.[7]

        Plant breeding developed in the late 17th and 18th centuries. These innovations 
        were drawn and presented in the botanical gardensand in private court collections. 
        At the end of the 18th century, flower tables became part of the salons. 
        Furthermore, nurseries were flourishing in the 18th century, 
        which stocked thousands of plants, including citrus, jasmines, 
        mignonette, bays, myrtles, agaves and aloes.[7]

        Beginning in the mid-to-late 2010s, fashionable plants from earlier decades 
        were revitalized and popularized by social media, especially Instagram, with 
        "plantstagram" becoming a major driver of trendy plants. In 2015, 5 million 
        Americans took up plant-related hobbies.[22] In 2017, 30% of American households 
        purchased at least one houseplant.[23]

        Interest in houseplants exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 
        early 2020.[24]With people forced to spend more time indoors, many sought to 
        fill their homes with houseplants. Plants were mentioned on Instagram an average 
        of more than 3,000 times a day in July 2021 and the hashtag "#plantmom" had been 
        used more than 2.6 million times.[24] Plant sales in 2020 were at an all-time high, 
        which brought concerns about the environmental impact of the industry.[25]

          other aroids,[26] as well as the fiddle-leaf fig. This era saw a larger 
          interest in growing plants with interesting or attractive forms or foliage, 
          rather than focusing solely on flowers.[26]

      People have long ascribed psychological benefits to growing plants; this
      1915 caption states that "all your cares flee. As a nerve-soothing,
      health-giving, enthusing hobby, it has no equal."[46] There are also many
      claimed psychological and physiological benefits to having houseplants. A
      2022 systematic review with some meta-analyses included 42 studies which
      together measured the following human functions to study the benefits of
      indoor plants:

    <div style="max-width: 1000px; word-wrap: break-word">
      Although houseplants are commonly considered to have an active, positive
      effect on indoor air quality, much of the non-academic reporting on the
      subject is based on experiments involving the removal of volatile organic
      compounds (VOCs) from the air, the evidence for which is unclear.[37] The
      1989 NASA Clean Air Study was set up to research ways to clean the air in
      sealed environments such as space stations.[38] This included an early
      study on the ability of potted plants to remove VOCs, which concluded that
      plants, specifically a combination of their roots and the soil
      microorganisms, were highly effective.[39][37][40] However, this study
      tested plants in ways which are not representative of an indoor
      environment; in sealed chambers and with highly elevated levels of the
      VOCs benzene, trichloroethylene and formaldehyde.[39] Subsequent studies
      have confirmed the combined role of soil and roots[41][42] and showed that
      they were effective at cleaning in higher VOC concentrations, but only at
      lower concentrations after the process had been "kick-started" by a higher
      level of exposure.[40] Others have shown that is possible to artificially
      enrich the soil directly with VOC-degrading bacteria and achieve the same
      result, and posited that exposure to high VOC levels (or low levels but in
      bursts) during experiments and the subsequent increase in such bacteria
      may have been a cause of the large differences seen in the results of
      various studies.[42] A 2019 review paper calculated that it would require
      between 10 and 1000 houseplants per square meter to achieve the same level
      of VOC removal as occurs from passive exchange between indoor and outdoor
      air.[37] Houseplants do have a statistically significant effect on the
      concentrations of both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in normal indoor
      environments, reducing carbon dioxide levels by 10–25% and carbon monoxide
      levels by up to 90%.[43]

    <div style="max-width: 1000px; word-wrap: break-word">
      Most houseplants are species that have adapted to survive in a temperature
      range between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F) year-round, as those adapted for
      temperate environments require winter temperatures outside of normal
      indoor conditions.[28] Within that limitation, there are houseplants which
      are native to many different types of habitats, from tropical rainforests
      to succulents and cacti native to deserts. Many houseplants are either
      epiphytes or live in seasonally dry ecosystems that help them adapt to the
      dry indoor air and inconsistent watering many houseplants are subject to.
      Often, houseplants from tropical areas are understory plants, and because
      they grown in shady conditions naturally, they are often able to thrive in
      lower-light conditions.
