    <p>
      Most houseplants are species that have adapted to survive in a temperature
      range between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F) year-round, as those adapted for
      temperate environments require winter temperatures outside of normal
      indoor conditions.[28] Within that limitation, there are houseplants which
      are native to many different types of habitats, from tropical rainforests
      to succulents and cacti native to deserts. Many houseplants are either
      epiphytes or live in seasonally dry ecosystems that help them adapt to the
      dry indoor air and inconsistent watering many houseplants are subject to.
      Often, houseplants from tropical areas are understory plants, and because
      they grown in shady conditions naturally, they are often able to thrive in
      lower-light conditions.
