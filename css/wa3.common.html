      <!-- The history of houseplants is intertwined with the history of container
      gardening in general. Ancient Egyptians and Sumerians grew ornamental and
      fruiting plants in decorative containers.[citation needed] Ancient Greeks
      and the Romans cultivated laurel trees (Laurus nobilis) in earthenware
      vessels. In ancient China, potted plants were shown at garden exhibitions
      over 2,500 years ago.[citation needed] In the medieval era, gillyflowers
      were displayed in containers.[3] -->
