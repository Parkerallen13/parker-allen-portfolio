      Although houseplants are commonly considered to have an active, positive
      effect on indoor air quality, much of the non-academic reporting on the
      subject is based on experiments involving the removal of volatile organic
      compounds (VOCs) from the air, the evidence for which is unclear.[37] The
      1989 NASA Clean Air Study was set up to research ways to clean the air in
      sealed environments such as space stations.[38] This included an early
      study on the ability of potted plants to remove VOCs, which concluded that
      plants, specifically a combination of their roots and the soil
      microorganisms, were highly effective.[39][37][40] However, this study
      tested plants in ways which are not representative of an indoor
      environment; in sealed chambers and with highly elevated levels of the
      VOCs benzene, trichloroethylene and formaldehyde.[39] Subsequent studies
      have confirmed the combined role of soil and roots[41][42] and showed that
      they were effective at cleaning in higher VOC concentrations, but only at
      lower concentrations after the process had been "kick-started" by a higher
      level of exposure.[40] Others have shown that is possible to artificially
      enrich the soil directly with VOC-degrading bacteria and achieve the same
      result, and posited that exposure to high VOC levels (or low levels but in
      bursts) during experiments and the subsequent increase in such bacteria
      may have been a cause of the large differences seen in the results of
      various studies.[42] A 2019 review paper calculated that it would require
      between 10 and 1000 houseplants per square meter to achieve the same level
      of VOC removal as occurs from passive exchange between indoor and outdoor
      air.[37] Houseplants do have a statistically significant effect on the
      concentrations of both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in normal indoor
      environments, reducing carbon dioxide levels by 10â€“25% and carbon monoxide
      levels by up to 90%.[43]
